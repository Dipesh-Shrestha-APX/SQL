Q)) YOU SELL HOUSES AND HAVE TWO TABLES, LISTING AND PRICE . YOU WANT A TABLE WITH SALE PRICE AND LISTING PRICE ONLY IF YOU KNOW BOTH WHICH JOIN TO USE AND WHY?

=> you should use an inner join

Q)) YOU WNAT A REPORT OF WHETHER YOUR PATIENT HAV REACHED OUT TO YOU RO YOU HAVE REACHED OUT TO THEM . YOU ARE FINE WITH NULL FOR EITHER CONDITION WHICH JOIN SHALL YOU USE AND WHY AND WITH TABLE EXMAPLES?

=> you should use a full outer join.

Say you are interested in determining the number of languages spoken for each country. You want to present this information alongside each country's local_name, which is a field only present in the countries table and not in the languages table. You'll use a subquery inside FROM to bring information from these two tables together!

-- Select code, and language count as lang_num
SELECT code, COUNT(name) AS lang_num
FROM languages 
GROUP BY code

--------------------

-- Select local_name and lang_num from appropriate tables
SELECT local_name, lang_num
FROM countries,
  (SELECT code, COUNT(*) AS lang_num
  FROM languages
  GROUP BY code) AS sub
-- Where codes match
WHERE countries.code = sub.code
ORDER BY lang_num DESC;

-- Suppose you're interested in analyzing inflation and unemployment rate for certain countries in 2015. You are not interested in countries with "Republic" or "Monarchy" as their form of government, but are interested in all other forms of government, such as emirate federations, socialist states, and commonwealths.
You will use the field gov_form to filter for these two conditions, which represents a country's form of government. You can review the different entries for gov_form in the countries table.

-- Select relevant fields
SELECT code, inflation_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM economies
WHERE year = 2015 
  AND code NOT IN
-- Subquery returning country codes filtered on gov_form
	(
    SELECT code
    FROM countries
    WHERE gov_form LIKE '%Republic%' OR gov_form LIKE '%Monarchy%'
  )
ORDER BY inflation_rate;

--Your task is to determine the top 10 capital cities in Europe and the Americas by city_perc, a metric you'll calculate. city_perc is a percentage that calculates the "proper" population in a city as a percentage of the total population in the wider metro area, as follows:
city_proper_pop / metroarea_pop * 100


SELECT 
    cities.name, 
    cities.country_code, 
    cities.city_proper_pop, 
    cities.metroarea_pop, 
    (cities.city_proper_pop / cities.metroarea_pop * 100) AS city_perc
FROM cities
WHERE cities.name IN 
    (
        SELECT capital
        FROM countries
        WHERE continent LIKE '%Europe' OR continent LIKE '%America'
    )
AND cities.metroarea_pop IS NOT null
ORDER BY city_perc DESC
LIMIT 10;
